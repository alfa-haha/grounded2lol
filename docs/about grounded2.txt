# Grounded 2: The Ultimate Survival Adventure

## Game Description

Shrunk again, but the world is much larger. In this open-world, single-player or co-op survival adventure, craft weapons and armor, build your base, and traverse the playground on your buggy. But something else is out thereâ€”and it hasn't forgotten you.

Continuing the core gameplay mechanics of Grounded, the game features players controlling miniaturized characters who must survive in an oversized natural environment. The sequel is set in Brookhollow Park, a fictional suburban park with a visual design inspired by the early 1990s.

Grounded 2 is the highly anticipated sequel to the beloved survival crafting game, developed by Obsidian Entertainment. "Grounded 2 gave us a fresh start, a chance to rebuild the game from the ground up, push the world further, and finally introduce features like mounts, new biome structures, and a more narrative-driven experience," says Chris Parker, Game Director on Grounded 2.

The game transports players into a whimsical yet dangerous world where everyday objects become towering landmarks and insects transform into formidable creatures. Set in the nostalgic atmosphere of the early 1990s, players must navigate this perilous miniature world while uncovering the mysteries behind their shrinking predicament.
